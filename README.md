1-Understanding the GitHub Flow
https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
  Summary:
    Branches:
      When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas.
      There's only one rule: anything in the master branch is always deployable.
    Commits:
      Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was
      made.
      Commit messages are important, especially since Git tracks your changes and then displays them as commits once
      they're pushed to the server.
    Pull Requests:
      Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits.
      By using GitHub's @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or
      teams.
    Discuss and Review your code:
      You can also continue to push to your branch in light of discussion and feedback about your commits
      GitHub will show your new commits and any additional feedback you may receive in the unified Pull Request view.
    Deploy:
      Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your tests, you can deploy your changes to verify
      them in production. If your branch causes issues, you can roll it back by deploying the existing master into
      production.
    Merge: 
    Now that your changes have been verified in production, it is time to merge your code into the master branch.
    By incorporating certain keywords into the text of your Pull Request, you can associate issues with code. When
    your Pull Request is merged, the related issues are also closed.
